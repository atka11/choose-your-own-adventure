            By this time, the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough, so they came home to breakfast.
        </p>
        <p>
            “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!” said the great huge bear, in his great huge voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Somebody has been at my porridge!” said the middle bear, in his middle voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the little, small wee bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge pot, but the porridge was all gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!” said the little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the three bears went upstairs into their bedroom.
        </p>
        <p> 
            “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!” said the great, huge bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Somebody has been lying in my bed!” said the middle bear, in his middle voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            And when the little, small, wee bear came to look at his bed, upon the pillow there was Goldilocks snoring away, fast asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!” Said the little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.
