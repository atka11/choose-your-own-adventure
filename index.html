        Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. One of them was a little, small wee bear; one was a middle-sized bear, and the other was a great, huge bear.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, after they had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling. And while they were walking, a little girl came near the house. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This little girl had golden curls and everyone called her Goldilocks.
